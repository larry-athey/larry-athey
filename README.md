If something can be automated, I can probably figure out how to do it and make it work with the lowest powered device possible.

Certified and degreed experts generally don't care for me because I've been writing code since I was 14 and have absolutely zero college education. My little Timex Sinclair ZX81 didn't do anything unless you wrote some code in order for it to have something to do, so my teacher was _"sink or swim"_. I collect **experience miles**, not book smarts and 8x10 picture frames for fancy documents.
