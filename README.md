If something can be automated, I can probably figure out how to do it and make it work with the lowest powered device possible.

Certified and degreed experts generally don't care for me because I've been writing code since I was 14. My little Timex Sinclair ZX81 didn't do anything unless you wrote some code in order for it to have something to do. I have absolutely zero formal training and haven't encountered a case yet where I actually need it.
