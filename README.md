# Larry Athey, owner of Panhandle Ponics R&D

_If something can be automated, I can probably figure out how to do it and make it all work with the lowest powered device possible._

Certified and degreed experts generally don't care for me because I've been writing code since I was 14 and have absolutely zero college education. My little Timex Sinclair ZX81 didn't do anything unless you wrote some code in order for it to have something to do, so my teacher was _**"sink or swim"**_. I collect **experience miles**, not book smarts and 8x10 picture frames for documents.

Outside of my open source projects, I only do freelance programming/scripting work for small projects, I have no interest in joining a development team. If you are a small business owner and need a freelance programmer for a small project, feel free to contact me from [my website](https://panhandleponics.com/#contact). I work a full time engineering job, so I have limited availability for phone calls during business hours.

The code repositories below are just projects that I've begun since I created a GitHub account. I couldn't begin to say how many projects I've had in the past 45 years and things that I've made open source long before GitHub ever came into existence. If you have any old shareware CD-ROMs from back in the BBS days, you likely have a bunch of my work piled up within those things.
